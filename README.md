## The Problem
Throughout my time at my current company, I've invested a lot of energy into the transition away from paper forms as a method of internal data collection. The advantages of making the change to digital data capture are numerous:
* Improvement in data accuracy
* No lag time in potential analysis due to lack of need for manual entry
* Environmental friendliness
* Increased productivity due to no time wasted manually entering data
* Decrease in data redundancy
* Removes clutter typically accompanied by storing paper documents

*...and the list goes on*

One form in particular caught my eye as a perfect candidate for kicking off the transition away from paper data collection. It captures vital quality data which is utilized in giving stakeholders on the production team a clear idea of production performance, and also happens to steal much precious time from our quality engineer, who currently manually enters the collected data. 

## The Solution

FNow that I've found a web development environment based in python, develop a web app that could be run on the final inspectors' samsung tablets out on the production floor. Each submission would route the data captured in the digital form directly to the company's data warehouse staging area.
